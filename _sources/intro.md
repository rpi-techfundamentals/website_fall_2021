## Webex Teams: Classroom and Asynchronous Discussions and Questions
I want to be very responsive to your questions and concerns as we go through the class.  Webex Teams *(NOT EMAIL)* is the best way to reach me.  I would suggest downloading the Webex Teams application for your phone and desktop.  Because Webex meeting chats do not persist, we are going to use the Webex Teams space for text discussions.
