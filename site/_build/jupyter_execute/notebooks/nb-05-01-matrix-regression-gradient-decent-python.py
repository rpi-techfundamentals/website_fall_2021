# ## Setup

# First, let's make sure this notebook works well in both python 2 and 3, import a few common modules, ensure MatplotLib plots figures inline and prepare a function to save the figures:

# In[1]:


# To support both python 2 and python 3
#from __future__ import division, print_function, unicode_literals

# Common imports
import numpy as np
import os

# to make this notebook's output stable across runs
np.random.seed(42)

# To plot pretty figures
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = 14
plt.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = 12
plt.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = 12


# In[2]:


# Let's generate some random data. 
import numpy as np
X = 2 * np.random.rand(100, 1)
y = 4 + 3 * X + np.random.randn(100, 1)


# In[3]:


plt.plot(X, y, "b.")
plt.xlabel("$x_1$", fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel("$y$", rotation=0, fontsize=18)
plt.axis([0, 2, 0, 15])


# ## Linear Regression 
# 
# - Linear regression involves fitting the optimal values for \theta that minimize the error.
# 
# $$h_0(x) = \theta_0 + \theta_1x$$
# 
# Below, we are just adding a constant using the [numpy concatenate function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.c_.html).

# In[4]:


#This will add a 1 to the X matrix
X_b = np.c_[np.ones((100, 1)), X]  # add x0 = 1 to each instance
X_b


# ## Linear regression using the Normal Equation
# 
# Using matrix calculus, we can actually solve for the optimal value for theta. 
# 
# The regression question below calculates the optimal theta. These are the coefficients relevant to understand. 
# 
# ## $$ \theta = (X^T X)^{-1}X^T \vec{y} $$
# 
# In order to calculate this, we are using the `dot` product function for Numpy and `T` to transpose matrix. `linalg.inv(a)` takes the inverse. 
# 
# `np.linalg.inv(X_b.T.dot(X_b)).dot(X_b.T).dot(y)`

# In[5]:


theta_best = np.linalg.inv(X_b.T.dot(X_b)).dot(X_b.T).dot(y)


# In[6]:


#This is the intercept and the coefficient. 
theta_best


# In[7]:


#This just Calcultes the line.
X_new = np.array([[0], [2]])
X_new_b = np.c_[np.ones((2, 1)), X_new]  # add x0 = 1 to each instance
y_predict = X_new_b.dot(theta_best)
y_predict


# The figure in the book actually corresponds to the following code, with a legend and axis labels:

# In[8]:


plt.plot(X_new, y_predict, "r-", linewidth=2, label="Predictions")
plt.plot(X, y, "b.")
plt.xlabel("$x_1$", fontsize=18)
plt.ylabel("$y$", rotation=0, fontsize=18)
plt.legend(loc="upper left", fontsize=14)
plt.axis([0, 2, 0, 15])


# In[9]:


# We can also do this much easier with the linear regression model. 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
lin_reg = LinearRegression()
lin_reg.fit(X, y)
lin_reg.intercept_, lin_reg.coef_


# In[10]:


lin_reg.predict(X_new)


# ## Linear regression using batch gradient descent
# 
# Where `m` is the number of iteratations
# 
# (1) $$Gradient = \frac{2}{m}X^T(X\theta - y)$$
# 
# (2) $$\theta = \theta - \eta Gradient$$
# 
# (3) $$\theta := \theta - \eta\frac{2}{m}X^T(X\theta - y)$$
# 

# In[11]:



eta = 0.1#learning rate
n_iterations = 1000
m = 100 #size of training set
theta = np.random.randn(2,1) #Starting point.

for iteration in range(n_iterations):
  gradients = 2/m * X_b.T.dot(X_b.dot(theta) - y)
  theta = theta - eta * gradients
  print("Ending:", theta)


# In[12]:


#
theta


# In[13]:


X_new_b.dot(theta)

#       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
#       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
#       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
